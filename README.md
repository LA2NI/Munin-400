# Munin 400
 400W HF Amplifier
Munin 400 uses a pair of MRF300AN/ MRF300BN LDMOS Transistors from NXP. The .pdf file named MRF300AN/BN_1p8_150MHz_PDF.pdf is an Application Report from NXP describing the use of the transistors in a 400W HF/VHF Power Amplifier that is delivering 400W PEP on all amateur bands from 1,8 MHz to 145 MHz. By using a special transformer on the input they get 400W PEP also on 145 MHz. I have not been able to find the described transformer but the prototype I have tested is very broad banded. I have not tested it on VHF at all.
The PCB layout is for use with the schematic named Munin 400_rev2.pdf. At the moment(September 2021) I am building a complete PA with Power supply and ATU built in. I reclon that IÂ´ll test it in the nearese future.
